No routine scoring errors were detected. Please notify us if you feel anything was missed.

Here's a breakdown of points allocation across all players and matches. This data helps to understand for example that player elims accounted for 12.5% of all points earned this session and 5.6% of the points were given out for thanking the bus driver, LOL. E1/D1/TR are the times you got the first game elim (E1), or were first to die (D1), and your thankfulness rate for the bus driver (TR).  

| Points | PtsNet | Penalty | Placmt | Elims  | NPCelim | Survivl | Siphon | ThksBus |
| :----: | :----: | :----:  | :----: | :----: | :----:  | :----:  | :----: | :----:  |
|2,531|1,548|38.8%|11.8%|12.5%|0.4%|38.6%|10.5%|5.6%|

- Placement: 1st = 5 pts down to 10th = 0.5 pt
