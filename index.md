I'll be scoring MOH customs today, results posted about 5 minutes after each match. For now, check out the archive below for [PRIOR SESSIONS](#past-events).

We had 5 matches with 187 unique people and the biggest lobby had 98 playing. We had 20 people who played every match. The highest XP level was 'MoH Andreaaa' at 389! The lowest XP was 'SikeBiShh91' at 10, welcome to our lobby, friend. Most common skin was Spider-Man (14 times), common axe was Harley Hitter (9 times). Guess what, we eliminated 11 NPCs, RIP! By the way, 20 people need to turn off ANONYMOUS MODE.

### ACTIVE POINTS ALGORITHM 2022.08.27:
- Placement: 1st = 5 pts down to 10th = 0.5 pt
- Elim: 2 pt per elim (max 5 elims per match)
- Survival: 0.15 pt per minute (about 3pts to end game)
- Elim Siphon: 0.5 pt for each of your victim's kill count
- Bonus: 8 pts if you're the first eliminated (self-elim doesn't count)
- Bonus: 2 pt for thanking bus driver
- _**PENALTY**_: -5.0 pts first elim of the game (NPC's don't count)
- _**PENALTY**_: -10.0 pts for anonymous mode (each match)

Here's a breakdown of points allocation across all players and matches. This data helps to understand for example that elims accounted for 13.0% of all points earned this session and 4.0% of the points were given out for just being the first one to be eliminated, LOL. E1 are points for getting first elimination and D1 is for being the first one to BE eliminated. TR is the bus driver thanks percentage!

| Points | Penalties | Placement | Elims  | NPCKill | Survival | Siphon | FirstElim | FirstDead | ThanksBus |

# Upcoming tournaments and Customs

**August 27th TODAY** - Makeouthill's customs today, I'm scoring for my own research and fun. Check out [MakeouthillFB](https://www.twitch.tv/makeouthillfb) for his livestream.

**August 2022** - Skip's Trios tournament. More to come on this soon.  

**October 2022** - CPK's CASH$ tournament. This might be solos, invites will get the custom code first, then we public fill. Something like best 5 of 6 games scoring or possibly a two-day thing? Maybe $200 to win, $100 2nd, $100 viewers choice, $100 to the coolest bot. (working on an algorithm, but we're gonna make it fun even if you don't dominate). Streamers welcome, everyone gets promoted on the tournament page and we'll do live scoring at the end of each game including analytics on kill feed and other cool stuff.

I'm working on a tournament scoring tool that uses Unreal Engine .replay files. Someday you'll be able to manage your own tournaments, drop .replay files, validate players, setup custom scoring algorithms, and more.
