Data updates ~5 minutes after each match. We had 9 matches with 65 unique people and the biggest lobby had 25 playing. There were 3 people who played every match. The highest XP level was 'sunshinehanne' at 295. The lowest XP was 'boskololez ttv' at 2, welcome to our lobby you GOAT! About 49.0% of us used girl skins. Guess what, we eliminated five NPCs, they will be back next game though. One person was ANON mode, big sad. Nine people have donkey laugh in their locker emotes, HEE HAW!

* Most common skins: Bonejamin(4), LennoxRose(4), MeowSkulls(4)<br>
* Most common pickaxes: SigiloftheEmpire(5), LectrostaticImpactor(4), RoseLightDaggers(4)<br>
* Most common emotes: CrowningAchievement(21), TheDip(13), Steady(10)<br>

Bot identified 2 error occurances affecting 1 player(s) with a net error balance of 0.00. Only ~1.92 total tournament points are at question due to kill feed data discrepancies. Affected players are: Relaxed Fit Jonesy. Let me know if you feel like it's important to fix this, but I'll have to get your .replay file or watch your stream to confirm.

Here's a breakdown of points allocation across all players and matches. This data helps to understand for example that player elims accounted for 4.8% of all points earned this session and 12.0% of the points were given out for thanking the bus driver, LOL.

| Gross  | Penlty | Final  | Placmt | Anon   | Survivl  | ThksBus | YouDed | Elims  | Siphon | NPC    |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----:   | :----:  | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |

This table shows placement result sorted by points. Bold **player name** means they use anonymous mode at least once. Placement and elim data shows the average value, then individual matches in <brackets>. All prize information and data is subject to a final review before "payout". E1 is how many times you scored the first elim of the game, K1 is for first knock, and D1 is for when you were the first to be dead. TR is the bus driver thanking percentage.
