Bot identified 1 error occurances affecting 1 player(s) with a net error balance of -0.96. Only ~0.96 total tournament points are at question due to kill feed data discrepancies. Affected players are: Críp Wãlkíñ. Let me know if you feel like it's important to fix this, but I'll have to get your .replay file or watch your stream to confirm.

Here's a breakdown of points allocation across all players and matches. This data helps to understand for example that player elims accounted for 15.7% of all points earned this session and 12.4% of the points were given out for thanking the bus driver, LOL.

# About
I'm working on a tournament scoring tool that uses Unreal Engine .replay files. Someday you'll be able to manage your own tournaments, drop .replay files, validate players, setup custom scoring algorithms, and more. Check out my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cpk_kaso) and the CPK [Discord](https://www.twitch.tv/cpk_jamieo).
