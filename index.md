Bot identified 8 error occurances affecting 7 player(s) with a net error balance of 20.00. Only ~40.00 total tournament points are at question due to kill feed data discrepancies. Affected players are: Cold Blooded Suit, Goya-_-16, H3ctic JapJim, HDR tiger, NICKO on FB, twitch tigerwyd, TwitchDestro. Let me know if you feel like it's important to fix this, but I'll have to get your .replay file or watch your stream to confirm.

Here's a breakdown of points allocation across all players and matches. This data helps to understand for example that player elims accounted for -573.3% of all points earned this session and 0.0% of the points were given out for thanking the bus driver, LOL.

| Gross  | Penlty | Final  | Placmt | Anon   | Survivl  | ThksBus | YouDed | Elims  | Siphon | NPC    |

This table shows placement result sorted by points. Bold **player name** means they use anonymous mode at least once. Placement and elim data shows the average value, then individual matches in brackets. All prize information and data is subject to a final review before payout. E1 is how many times you landed the first elim of the game, K1 is for first knock, and D1 is for when you were the first to be dead. TR is the bus driver thanking percentage.
