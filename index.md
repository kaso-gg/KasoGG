Bot identified 6 error occurances affecting 6 player(s) with a net error balance of 0.00. Only ~5.75 total tournament points are at question due to kill feed data discrepancies. Affected players are: Ag8teFirE, CPK_kaso, LooseClipz-19, MR KC SPAMZ, Nicholas3206, Silent sender. Let me know if you feel like it's important to fix this, but I'll have to get your .replay file or watch your stream to confirm.

Here's a breakdown of points allocation across all players and matches. This data helps to understand for example that player elims accounted for 24.1% of all points earned this session and 21.5% of the points were given out for thanking the bus driver, LOL.

# Upcoming tournaments and Customs
**October 2022** - CPK's CASH$ tournament. This might be solos, invites will get the custom code first, then we public fill. Something like best 5 of 6 games scoring or possibly a two-day thing? Maybe $200 to win, $100 2nd, $100 viewers choice, $100 to the coolest bot. (working on an algorithm, but we're gonna make it fun even if you don't dominate). Streamers welcome, everyone gets promoted on the tournament page and we'll do live scoring at the end of each game including analytics on kill feed and other cool stuff.

I'm working on a tournament scoring tool that uses Unreal Engine .replay files. Someday you'll be able to manage your own tournaments, drop .replay files, validate players, setup custom scoring algorithms, and more.
