This table shows placement result sorted by points. Bold **player name** means they use anonymous mode at least once. Placement and elim data shows the average value, then individual matches in brackets. All prize information and data is subject to a final review before payout. E1 is how many times you landed the first elim of the game, K1 is for first knock, and D1 is for when you were the first to be dead. TR is the bus driver thanking percentage.
