Results from [PRIOR SESSIONS](#past-events) are linked at the bottom of the page. The most recent scoring results will be on this page during the event. Updates happen usually 3-4 minutes after the end of match.

Next time I play some customs, either mine or someone else's, I'll be updaing this about 5 minutes after every match we play. I have to be in the customs and either win (LOL) or at least spectate to the end so I have a full replay file. Then I load and process that data and present it here. We can create a LOT of different scoring algorithms.

### ACTIVE POINTS ALGORITHM FOR NEXT EVENT:
- Placement: 1st is 5 pts down to 10th = 0.5 pt
- Noc/Elim: 1 pt per elim
- Elim Siphon: 0.5 pt for each of your victim's kill count
- Survival: 0.15 pt per minute (about 3pts to end game)
- Bus: 1 pt for thanking bus driver
- NPCs: 1.5 pt for the first 5 NPCs of the game, 1.0 pt for all others
- NPC Multipliers: **2.5x** for Vader, **1.5x** for Troopers
- BONUS: 8 pts first dead down to 2 pts fifth to die...13 pts 13th to die
- PENALTY: -5 pts first elim, -2.5 second elim (NPC's don't count)
- PENALTY: -10 pts anon mode

# Upcoming tournaments and Customs

**October 2022** - CPK's CASH$ tournament. This might be solos, invites will get the custom code first, then we public fill. Something like best 5 of 6 games scoring or possibly a two-day thing? Maybe $200 to win, $100 2nd, $100 viewers choice, $100 to the coolest bot. (working on an algorithm, but we're gonna make it fun even if you don't dominate). Streamers welcome, everyone gets promoted on the tournament page and we'll do live scoring at the end of each game including analytics on kill feed and other cool stuff.

# About
I'm working on a tournament scoring tool that uses Unreal Engine .replay files. Someday you'll be able to manage your own tournaments, drop .replay files, validate players, setup custom scoring algorithms, and more. Check out my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cpk_kaso) and the CPK [Discord](https://www.twitch.tv/cpk_jamieo).
