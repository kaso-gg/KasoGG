The lowest XP was 'SikeBiShh91' at 10, welcome to our lobby, friend. Most common skin was Spider-Man (14 times), common axe was Harley Hitter (9 times). Guess what, we eliminated 11 NPCs, RIP! By the way, 20 people need to turn off ANONYMOUS MODE.

Here's a breakdown of points allocation across all players and matches. This data helps to understand for example that elims accounted for 13.0% of all points earned this session and 4.0% of the points were given out for just being the first one to be eliminated, LOL. E1 are points for getting first elimination and D1 is for being the first one to BE eliminated. TR is the bus driver thanks percentage!

| Points | Penalties | Placement | Elims  | NPCKill | Survival | Siphon | FirstElim | FirstDead | ThanksBus |

**August 2022** - Skip's Trios tournament. More to come on this soon.

Maybe $200 to win, $100 2nd, $100 viewers choice, $100 to the coolest bot. (working on an algorithm, but we're gonna make it fun even if you don't dominate). Streamers welcome, everyone gets promoted on the tournament page and we'll do live scoring at the end of each game including analytics on kill feed and other cool stuff.

# About
I'm working on a tournament scoring tool that uses Unreal Engine .replay files. Someday you'll be able to manage your own tournaments, drop .replay files, validate players, setup custom scoring algorithms, and more. Check out my [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/cpk_kaso) and the CPK [Discord](https://www.twitch.tv/cpk_jamieo).
