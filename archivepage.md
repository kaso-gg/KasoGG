Bot identified 1 error occurances affecting 1 player(s) with a net error balance of -5.00. Only ~5.00 total tournament points are at question due to kill feed data discrepancies. Affected players are: . Let me know if you feel like it's important to fix this, but I'll have to get your .replay file or watch your stream to confirm.

This table shows placement result sorted by points. Bold **player name** means they use anonymous mode at least once. Placement and elim data shows the average value, then individual matches in brackets. All prize information and data is subject to a final review before payout. E1 is how many times you landed the first elim of the game, K1 is for first knock, and D1 is for when you were the first to be dead. TR is the bus driver thanking percentage.
